Will runs a spaceship repair business


A spaceship repair business where you need to launch expensive spaceship parts to space dry docks for customers. Aim is to make some profit before you go bankrupt with debt. Investors (viewers) make investments giving you some cash to spend in a market to make life easier, but require a large return on their investment after many hours. Their investment accures interest after the payback period.
Supporting workforce has to be researched and then paid an hourly wage when they are on shift
All high tech personal equipment must be brought through the market which is at spawn area.

Designed for play in multiplayer as a streamer with viewers acting as investors.
