# Factorio-Wills-Spaceship-Repair
Will runs a spaceship repair business


A spaceship repair business where you need to launch expensive spaceship parts to space for customer orders. Aim is to make some profit before you go bankrupt with debt. Investors (viewers) make investments giving you some cash to spend in a market to make life easier, but require a large return on their investment after many hours. Their investment accures interest after the payback period.
Delivering spaceship parts in to space requires an available dry dock to be in space and for an order to be decrypted (researched). If the order is fulfilled witihn the time limit a time bonus/penalty payment will be made in coins to the silo. These coins can be spent in the market or processed and sent off via rocket to the bank. Rocket silos and coin handling machines are infrequently randomly placed across the map and can not be manually made.
Supporting workforce has to be researched and then paid an hourly wage when they are on shift
All high tech personal equipment must be brought through the market which is at spawn area.

Designed for play in multiplayer as a streamer with viewers acting as investors.
